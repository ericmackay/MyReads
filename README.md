###My Reads Project
A web app for organizing Books by Read, Want to Read, and Currently Reading.

###Getting Started

This project is developed with React using nodeJS, and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

###Installing

Download or clone the project

`git@github.com:ericmackay/reactnd-project-myreads.git`

When it finishes you need install the node modules by running

`npm install`

After that you would able to start our app

`npm start`

And that's it, the app will be opened in your default browser

###Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md) That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
